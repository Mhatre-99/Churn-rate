# Churn-rate
The data is of a fintech company which provides a subscription product to it's users, which allows them to manage their bank accounts.
I've used the data to identify users who are likely to cancel their subscription.
Also find some useful insights about the customers.
I've used Logistic regression for prediciting whether the customer will churn.
